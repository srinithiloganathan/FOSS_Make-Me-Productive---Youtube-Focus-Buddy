## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing this project.

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.
2. Toggle "Make Me Productive" to enable or disable filtering.
3. Visit YouTube to see the changes in action.
4. Check your productivity stats in the popup window:

## File Structure

- `content.js`: Main logic for filtering YouTube videos, handling overlays, and tracking stats.
- `popup.html` / `popup.js`: User interface for toggling the filter and viewing productivity stats.
- `manifest.json`: Chrome extension manifest and permissions.
- `icon.png`: Extension icon.

## How It Works

1. **Content Script**:
   - Scans for video elements, including breaking news and Shorts.
   - Hides distracting videos and overlays them with motivational messages.
   - Tracks stats and watch time for educational and entertainment content.

2. **Popup**:
   - Lets you enable or disable the filter.
   - Displays real-time productivity statistics.

3. **Manifest**:
   - Defines extension permissions, content scripts, and popup configuration.

## Customization

- **Distracting Keywords**: Edit the `entertainmentKeywords` array in `content.js`.
- **Educational Keywords**: Edit the `educationalKeywords` array in `content.js`.
- **Motivational Messages**: Customize the `distractingKeywordMessages` object in `content.js`.

### Example keyword sets (recommended starting point)
- Entertainment keywords: short, prank, meme, trailer, reaction, vlog, funny, gaming, music video, dance, gossip, celebrity, drama, challenge
- Educational keywords: tutorial, how to, lecture, course, lesson, explain, guide, walkthrough, lecture, study, tutorial, documentary, science, programming, math, history

## Permissions

This extension requires:
- **Storage**: To save settings and stats.
- **Tabs**: To reload the active tab when toggling the filter.

## Upcoming features

Planned improvements and near-term work:
- Add better keywords: expanded, categorized default lists (tutorials, coding, science, language), synonym expansion, and community-importable keyword packs.
- Optional ML-assisted classifier: lightweight classifier to improve precision beyond keywords.
- Per-channel and per-playlist whitelists/blacklists.
- Scheduled focus sessions (pomodoro-style) and auto-enable filters during sessions.
- Export/import productivity data (CSV) and manual backup.
- Improved popup UI: trends, historical graphs, and configurable goals.
- Community keyword sharing and moderation workflow (opt-in).
- Accessibility and i18n support for non-English keywords.

## Development

- To test changes quickly:
  - Update files in the project folder.
  - In chrome://extensions reload the unpacked extension.
- Use the console on YouTube pages (DevTools) to debug content script logs.

## Privacy & Security

- All processing happens locally in the browser.
- No data is sent to external servers.
- Uses Chrome Storage for local settings and stats only.

## Troubleshooting

- If filtering doesn't appear:
  - Ensure the extension is enabled in chrome://extensions.
